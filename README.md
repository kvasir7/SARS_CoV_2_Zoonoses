# SARS_CoV_2_Zoonoses
Pandemic model with zoonotic and reverse zoonotic dynamics

This repository will serve in the development of an ODE model to be solved with numerical methods. The primary goal is to incorporate zoonotic and reverse zoonotic (anthroponotic) cycling into a model for epidemics/pandemics. This will be informed by field surveillance data of SARS-CoV-2 in wildlife populations.
